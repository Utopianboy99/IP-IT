    "short": "From a kitchen table to a global community. Cognition Berries began with one simple belief: everyone deserves a fair chance to understand money.",
    "full": "Cognition Berries started in 2020 when Amara noticed something troubling: young people in her community had dreams but no map. They wanted to invest, build businesses, and save for the future—but no one had ever taught them how.\n\nSo Amara did what any determined teacher does. She sat down at her kitchen table with a cup of tea, a whiteboard, and a question: 'What if I made money fun and simple?'\n\nHer first 'students' were her younger sister, two cousins, and a neighbour's son. They met in the lounge, worked through real examples (like what a stock really is), and celebrated small wins together. Within weeks, two of them had opened their first investment accounts.\n\nWord spread. Soon, the meetings moved to a church hall. Then online when the world changed in 2020. Today, Cognition Berries reaches learners in 15 countries—from Lagos to London, from Nairobi to New York.\n\nWe still teach the same way: with kindness, no shame, real examples, and the belief that building wealth is a skill anyone can learn.",

      "a": "Yes. Always will be. We believe everyone deserves a fair introduction to financial literacy. After that, you can explore premium courses if you want deeper dives into investing, tax strategy, or business. But the foundation? Free."
    },
    {
      "q": "How much time do I need to commit?",
      "a": "10–15 minutes per lesson. That's it. Most people do one lesson a week. Some do two. You set the pace. Life is busy—we get it. We designed lessons you can actually fit into your day."
    },
    {
      "q": "What if I have questions?",
      "a": "Ask. Our coaches respond within 24 hours. No dumb questions here. We're human too, and we remember how scary money talk feels at first. Chat with the community or message a coach directly."
    },
    {
      "q": "Do you have a certificate at the end?",
      "a": "Yes! After you complete a course, you get a certificate and a digital badge. More importantly, you get real knowledge and confidence. That's what matters."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can I learn offline or download lessons?",
      "a": "Video lessons can be downloaded on our mobile app. Quizzes and community features require internet. We're working on better offline support for areas with spotty connectivity."
